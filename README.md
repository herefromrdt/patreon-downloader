## Usage

When viewing a Patreon Post page, you can use the `Patreon Downloader` to quickly download the media and attachments from that post as a zip in your Downloads folder.

The zip file name will be pre-filled for you based on the Patreon creator's name and the title of the post.

For example, if you were downloading from creator `JohnSmith` and the title of the post was `These are some of my favourite things...` you would be given a zip file called `johnsmith-these-are-some-of-my-favourite-things.zip`.

Simply change the file name to suit you.

## FAQ

1. Can I use this to download every post a creator has ever made?
   - "Yes", but probably not how you want. You will need to go to each page of the creator's posts and download them all individually.
2. Can I download "private" posts? Or download posts that I don't have the appropriate access level to see on Patreon?
   - No, you can only download assets that you would normally be able to manually click on and download.
